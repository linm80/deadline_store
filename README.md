### Custom Assembly

Does one of our existing original boards almost meet your needs, but isn’t a perfect fit?
Do you wish it had a specific connector, a pigtail, or certain pins populated with a header? We can modify existing boards to add or remove components to fit your needs, creating the ideal board for you.

### Development Board Design & Manufacturing

Turn your sensors, ICs, modules and components into easy-to-use breakout boards. Our engineers will finesse your product, helping you achieve market share faster. SparkFun’s development boards streamline your customers’ ability to integrate your tech into their prototypes.

### Custom Kit Development

With our Custom Kit program, you can create the exact kit you need. Tell us the components you need, or we can collaborate with you to define parts needed and develop a customer experience based on your idea. Once the kit is ready, we will either ship it to you or build a custom web page where your customers can purchase it directly from us.
